                                    breakdown or accident with excellent UX so to relieve them as much as possible. It

                                    Let’s be honest — the road traffic regulations in Germany and abroad can be complicated. 
                                    In a stressful situation, hardly anyone knows exactly how far the warning triangle must 
                                    be placed from the car. Rescyou eliminates this uncertainty completely. The further it 
                                    is moved away from the car, the more an LED strip fills up until the correct distance is 
                                    reached and a second indicator signals to set the triangle on the ground. And it simply 
                                    works automatically, like magic. There is a B2C version that can be installed in any car, 
                                    whereas the B2B version is integrated in the trunk trim panel by the car manufacturer.

                                <p>In this one week design sprint my team and I put Porsches new in-house built
                                    prototyping and

                                    storytelling tool to the test. Therefore we deleloped a new potential feature for
                                    their

                                    new Porsche Mission E Cross Turismo. Protecting the driver in a situation of first
                                    responder at a crash

                                    sight. It was important to consider not only the interior screens, but the whole car
                                    with all its sensors,

                                    phyisical feedbacks, and indicators. In an extreme situation like the one shown, it
                                    was very important to guide the

                                    drivers view very percisely and just giving him the information needed.</p>

                                <p><b>Insights and research</b></p>

                                <p>Our initial approach was to tackle the topic »first aid«. Since even in our team of

                                    young

                                    drivers, no one was confident about the procedures. And our

                                    research with people in the average Porsche driver age only confirmed our

                                    assumptions.

                                    But when we turned to the department of the firefighters Potsdam,

                                    we learned, that inexpert first aid is rarely a problem nowadays – but self

                                    protection

                                    at the crash scene is! Quote: »If you’re dead yourself, you can't help anyone
                                    else«!</p>

                                <br>

                                <p><b>Idea</b></p>

                                <p>Therefore we changed our focus from assisting first responders to help others to

                                    assist

                                    the first responders protecting themselves. In our further research we shadowed

                                    people

                                    while they handled an improvised crash scene situation. The learnings of this

                                    shadowing

                                    combined with the insights provided by the fire fighters was the foundation on witch

                                    we built »Danger Zone« – our Storytelling and Prototyping approach to keep first

                                    responders safe.</p><br>

                                <p>»allgood« is a p2p sick pay cover for freelancers. It is the result of

                                    crafting

                                    a finance related product, that on one hand builds trust while on

                                    due to the fear of financial losses. Through our research we found fairly good

                                    solutions

                                    already tackling the problem offline. Like the

                                    Due to the oversupply of games and possibilities in this area, the user is often

                                    with countless decisions.

                                    The price often plays a major role. Despite their good storylines, many games have a

                                    limited number of missions

                                    and not every game can be played online against other players for an unlimited

                                    time. In the long run the player needs new challenges, i.e. new games. Although
                                    there

                                    are already portals for the direct download of new games on the Playstation, Xbox
                                    and Co.

                                    platforms, the hardcover versions of these games are unlikely to decrease
                                    significantly in the coming years.

                                <p>On a computer, shared folders have become the backbone for collaborative working. A
                                    regular

                                    file system, however, doesn’t live up to the demands of a productive collaborative
                                    space.

                                    It is no longer enough to know where a file is located. Users need more contextual
                                    information

                                    like who was working when on which file. Furthermore, jumping back in the project
                                    timeline and

                                    reading the communication in the team that is related to specific files is often
                                    essential for

                                    understanding and modifying the current state of the project.</p><br>

                                <p>This problem was the starting point for the Data Resonance Imaging project. The
                                    project investigates

                                    how a visual representation of file properties and histories as well as an
                                    associated group chats

                                    can support users in understanding and using the file structure. </p><br>

                                <p>Data Resonance Imaging creates a visual model of a »project flow«. New files are
                                    created, old ones

                                    deleted. As the activity shifts from file A to file B, collaboration patterns
                                    emerge. With DRI,

                                    it is possible to target specific temporal points in the file system history and
                                    examine the context

                                    of the selected time frame. Keywords and highlights from the group chat provide the
                                    users with

                                    contextual information. The visual representation of file properties like »activity«

                                    (the amount of file operations per time frame) support the understanding of the
                                    project flow.</p><br>
